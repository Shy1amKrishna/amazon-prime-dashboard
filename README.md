📊 Amazon Prime Movies & TV Shows Dashboard — Power BI Project

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze the Amazon Prime Movies & TV Shows dataset.
The goal was to explore the platform’s content trends and gain insights based on genre, release year, ratings, and country distribution.

This is one of my beginner-friendly analytics projects to understand data cleaning, data modeling, and visualization in Power BI.
